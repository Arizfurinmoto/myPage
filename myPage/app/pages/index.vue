                Hi! Welcome to my page. <br />I'm Szymon and it's a pleasure to
                provide you a little insight into my experience and skills :)

                I’ll start a bit unconventionally from a less formal side and write a few words about myself. I completed an engineering degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Information Systems Engineering at the Faculty of Applied Informatics and Mathematics at the Warsaw University of Life Sciences. At the same time, I pursued a Bachelor’s degree in Management at the University of Warsaw. In the final semester of my Bachelor’s studies, and right after defending my engineering thesis, I went on an Erasmus exchange to Madrid, where I spent half a year. I attended Universidad Rey Juan Carlos and took courses within the Business Management and Marketing programs. I also enrolled in two courses aimed at teaching students how to use Microsoft Word and Excel. I thought I already knew almost everything there was to know (as most people usually think about Word and Excel), but it turned out I learned a lot of new things. These were very valuable courses, with a clear emphasis on practical application.

                Due to my stay in Madrid as part of my studies at the University of Warsaw, I did not start a master’s degree in Computer Science (though I do not rule out returning to it). I am continuing my studies in Management, but now at the master’s level. After the first semester, I went once again on Erasmus, this time to Bilbao. There, I took marketing courses, including <em>Applications to Marketing Research</em>, where we learned a statistical approach to marketing research and the use of SPSS.

                During my bachelor’s studies, I worked as a web developer at a now-defunct company called Tarvos Creation. As funny as it may sound, after some time I held the position of Head of the IT Department there. Tarvos Creation was founded by a good friend of mine and his cousin, also during their studies. I joined as the third member and helped in building the company. By the time the business ended, our IT department consisted of four people. Within this role, I designed and developed websites and online stores for clients using WordPress and WooCommerce, with Elementor being the main plugin I worked with

                Currently, I am working on projects independently and have started an internship in the Data Management department at one of the largest technology companies in Poland: Sii Poland.

                I am shaping my career path around software development, whether in the form of desktop, mobile, or web applications; however, I am also open to the possibility of professionally exploring the world of marketing. <br></br>Already in primary school, I became interested in the Unity3D engine which is used for creating, among other things, games. In high school, I was introduced to C++ during classes, and as part of extracurricular activities, I completed a course in C# programming, followed by a course in computer game development with Unity3D.

                During my engineering studies, I worked extensively with C# and Python. I also gained experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, React Native, and Expo. Some of these technologies were used as part of my coursework, while others I explored on my own.

                For my engineering project, together with a good friend of mine, we developed a mobile application supporting the organization of 6-a-side football matches (a discipline now referred to as Socca). I was responsible for the front-end part. As part of the project, we used React Native with JavaScript, and Python with Flask and SQLite.

                In my Management studies, I mostly developed soft skills, which I believe are an excellent complement to my Computer Science background. Of course, I also became familiar with some IT tools, one of which is Power BI.

                I gained knowledge and skills in managing projects, processes, and resources. I developed critical thinking, communication and intercultural communication skills, time management, prioritization, teamwork, and a sense of responsibility.

                On a more personal note, for the past nine years I have been leading an amateur 6-a-side football (Socca) team called <em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/FCWombaty" class="contrast">FC Wombaty</a></em>. We played in the <em>Playarena Warszawa</em> league, and currently we participate in the <em>Liga Fanów</em>. Around 60 people have been part of my team so far, and I am currently managing a squad of 20 players.

                Additionally, I work out at the gym. I am a fan of the TV series <i>Seinfeld</i> and <i>The Office</i> (the American version, but as I recently discovered, also our Polish adaptation). I am a fan of FC Bayern Munich.
